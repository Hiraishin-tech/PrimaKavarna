The final project of the course I attended. Aside from the public side available to normal users you can also access the admin side of this project by going to this link: https://tomaspham.hiraishin.net/admin.php .After you log in you can change everything you want on the public side of the website for example: Adding new section of the website, delete web section, update texts and prices etc.
